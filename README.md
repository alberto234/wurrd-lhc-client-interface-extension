## Extension's configurations

A configuration tool is provided to make some changes to configuration after installation.

Type: `Boolean`

This is needed only if you attempt to login from your device and you receive error 501 or null. This is caused by this issue where some hosting providers block or redirect PUT and DELETE requests. Enable this checkbox if you experience an error logging in.

This is unique ID autogenerated upon installation and should not be changed.
